    <div class="block1">
    Throughout <br> the afternoon I <br> watched them there,<br>
    Snow-fairies falling, falling <br> from the sky,
    Whirling fantastic in <br>the misty air,
    Contending fierce for space supremacy.
    And they flew down a mightier force at night,
    </div>  
    <div class="block2">
    As though inheaven there was revolt and riot,
    And they, frail things had taken panic flight
    Down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet.
    I went to bed and rose at early dawn
    </div>
    <div class="block3">
    To see them huddled together in a heap,
    Each merged into the other upon the lawn,
    Worn out by the sharp struggle, fast asleep.
    The sun shone brightly on them half the day,
    </div>  
    <div class="block4">
    By night they stealthily had stolâ€™n away.
    </div>
