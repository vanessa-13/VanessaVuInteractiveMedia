        Throughout the afternoon I watched them there,
        Snow-fairies falling, falling from the sky,
        </div>
        <div class="medium">
        <em>Whirling fantastic in the misty air,
        Contending fierce for space supremacy.</em>
        </div>
        <div class="large">
        <strong>And they flew down a mightier force at night,
        As though in heaven there was revolt and riot,
        And they, frail things had taken panic flight</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="small">
        Down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet.
        </div>
        <div class="medium">
        <em>I went to bed and rose at early dawn
        To see them huddled together in a heap,
        Each merged into the other upon the lawn,
        Worn out by the sharp struggle, fast asleep.</em>
        </div>
        <div class="small">
        The sun shone brightly on them half the day,
        By night they stealthily had stolâ€™n away.
