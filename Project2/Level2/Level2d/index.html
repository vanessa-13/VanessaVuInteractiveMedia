            tched them there,
            <br>
            Snow-fairies falling, falling 
            <br>
             from the sky,
            <br>
            Whirling fantastic  
            <br>
            in the misty air, Contending fierce 
            <br>
            for space supremacy. And 
            <br>
            they flew down a mightier force at night, 
            <br>
            As though in heaven there was revolt and riot, and they, 
            <br>
            frail things had taken panic flight 
            <br>
            Down to the calm 
            <br>
            earth seeking peace and quiet. I went to bed 
            <br>
            and rose at early dawn To see them huddled together in a  
            <br>
            heap, Each merged into the other upon the lawn, Worn out by the sharp  
            <br>
            struggle, fast asleep. The sun shone brightly on them half the day, 
            <br>
            By night they 
            <br>
            stealthily had 
            <br>
            stolâ€™n away.
