    <div class="head"> Reading Response to <em>Play Profound</em> by Susan Rethorst</div>

    <div class="response">
        After finishing this reading I had a lot of thoughts. Mainly, I was impressed by how relatable the author was. Even though she had done different things in her life compared to me, I was still finding ways that I felt the same that she had felt. 
First was with her experience with dance as an art. I still feel like I struggle with only “doing” and not “talking”. My education has absolutely helped me with talking and thinking more deeply about my work. The author’s ability to take what she was given by her instructor and try was inspiring. I think even if she wasn’t successful in completing the task 100 percent all the time, there is value in at least trying. However it can be hard to try when the task is consistent in making one feel defeated.
Another aspect of the reading that piqued my interest was when the author discussed an anecdote of running a food cart, that involved her observation of conversational techniques. This was the biggest reason as to why I feel like I can relate to this author. I have someone in my life that is amazing at small-talk, making friends, and overall socializing with people. It’s something that I really admire about him, and was one of the first things I noticed about his character. Just like the author I would watch and observe how he acts. I would try to replicate his techniques. I did notice that you have to be more relaxed and friendly to encourage people to feel welcomed, but it was still relieving, in a sense, to hear that feeling and experience put into words by someone else.
	A third aspect that I took away from the reading is the practice of reflection or introspection. This would be in the context of creating or building something with meaning and intention. The author details the process of choreographing a dance performance; starting with an idea, then a roadblock, then a solution to the roadblock, and continued thinking about it until she got closer and closer to an idea she liked. It’s not quite the same idea she started with but it’s not something different, as the final product was built upon old ideas.
The process that she describes leads to the idea of pleasure and rigor. That they’re not as black and white as they seem. I think that she was trying to say that the process of a rigorous experience, if it’s something you want to do, can lead to the experience of pleasure. Which, in my eyes, means satisfaction from your efforts. Her anecdote of learning how to converse with people is an example of her trying and failing over and over until she found herself in a spot that she never could have imagined being when she started. To feel that satisfaction, or a personal sense of success, you must try and fail. I think that you must want to fail in order to feel satisfied.
All of her goals and dreams of accomplishing something or making something were built upon her will to learn and improve. She used to never talk about dance or talk with strangers, but now she’s able to have constructive conversations and friendly interactions with people. I think that the essence of her message is: if you fall down, pick yourself back up and keep going; to push yourself. I think that this is a very inspirational and moving reading. I can see aspects of myself that I don’t push far enough to remain in the comfort that I’m familiar with. After reading this I might try to make more opportunities to challenge myself.
